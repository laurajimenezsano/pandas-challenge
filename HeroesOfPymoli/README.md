# HEROES OF PYMOLI - Observations

### While the majority of the players are male (approx 84%), female buy more expensive items and have a higher average purchase total per person.

###  While most players are between the ages of 20-24, players of ages 35-39 years have the highest avg. purchase price and the avg. purchase total per person, followed by players of less than 10 years old. While a complete uncorroborated hypothesis between the demographics, it is possible that the parent of those of ages 10 or less are part of the group aged 35-39.

### The Final Critic item, despite not being the most expensive item, has been bought the most (13 times), being the item with the highest generated total revenue.
